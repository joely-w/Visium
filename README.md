# VisiumServer
Python server side for Visium. 
## Get started
1. Run setup command: `pip install -r ./src/requirements.txt`

This code currently runs on `src/data/postfit_SR.yaml` as a sample, once I've hooked up the routes to the 
right functions it will be a case of posting  a yaml file to an endpoint. 
To generate the current data run `src/graphs/histogram.py`. 

## Docs 
I've started writing docs for deployment, which can be found in `docs`.
